**Role Name**: Circuit Operator
**Alignment**: Technician (Town)

*As a child, you were always fascinated by circuits. Looking at the intricate patterns formed by the little wires brought you endless joy, so it was nobody’s surprise when you got your degree in electrical engineering and joined the Navy’s recruitment program. You know a little secret about the electronic doors in the crew quarters. Now, it’s time to put that knowledge to the test uncovering the hostile operatives on board your ship.*

**Day Abilities**: N/A.

**Night Abilities**: 
Each night, scan exactly three living players. You get to see how many visits there were to each of your targets.

**Passive Abilities**: N/A.

**Other Role Information**:
You may not scan yourself.

**Win Condition**: Identify and eliminate all threats to the submarine.



**Role Name**: Door Rigger
**Alignment**: Technician (Town)

*In all your 25 years of service in the Navy, you’ve never seen an attack as quite worrisome as this. You’re usually fairly relaxed, and very social with the rest of the crew, but your recent obsession with true crime podcasts has left you a little more paranoid than usual. You often lie awake at night worrying about the rest of the crew members, afraid they’re out to get you – that’s why you decide to strike back. Nobody’s gonna take down this sub without a fight!*

**Day Abilities**: N/A

**Night Abilities**: 
You may set a trap at your door through the night twice during the game (by targeting yourself). Once during the game, you may instead set a trap at someone else’s door (by visiting them). This trap deals a Strength 1 attack to all players who visit the trapped player during the night (except you).

**Passive Abilities**: N/A

**Other Role Information**:
You will know how many players triggered your trap. You cannot be roleblocked. Setting a trap does not confer protection.

**Win Condition**: Identify and eliminate all threats to the submarine.



**Role Name**: Radio Specialist
**Alignment**: Technician (Town)

*Nothing feels better to you than being on a submarine. Holding your hand up to the 9-inch steel hull with your eyes closed, imagining the cold and unforgiving darkness of the water outside is your comfort place – there’s truly nowhere you’d rather be than with your crew deep underwater. And of course, your trusty walkie-talkies, custom-made for you during a covert mission in Germany. As the attacks on your sub continue, it’s time for you to rally together with your team to protect it.*

**Day Abilities**:
You have four walkie-talkies (other than your own), which you may allocate during each day to up to four other living players. This allows up to five players to converse freely during the night in a private channel. If a player you give a walkie-talkie to dies during that night or the following day, the walkie-talkie is permanently lost with them.

**Night Abilities**: N/A

**Passive Abilities**: N/A

**Other Role Information**: N/A

**Win Condition**: Identify and eliminate all threats to the submarine.



**Role Name**: Proximity Engineer
**Alignment**: Technician (Town)

*Recruited to the Navy’s engineering program shortly after filing a brilliant patent on subdermal proximity sensors, your technical work on the submarine has not gone unnoticed. These little devices, which come in pairs, can be sneakily implanted under the skin and remotely send a signal to your console when their carriers come into contact with each other. With the attacks on your ship ramping up, maybe it’s time to put this technology to good use…*

**Day Abilities**: N/A

**Night Abilities**: 
Each night, you may visit two different players to secretly implant a subdermal proximity sensor in them. If the two players meet at any point during the night (A visits B, B visits A, A and B visit the same target), you will receive the location at which they met (A, B, or a common target).

**Passive Abilities**: N/A

**Other Role Information**: N/A



**Role Name**: Intubation Specialist
**Alignment**: Technician (Town)

*Getting rejected from your dream medical school was a blow, but it’s good that the military doesn’t care about the qualifications. Well, maybe they do, which is why it’s good you lied on your resumé! Wait, what do you mean “people are actually dying and it’s your job to save them”?*

**Day Abilities**: N/A

**Night Abilities**: 
You may visit a player to protect them, granting them Level 3 defence. If they are attacked and not otherwise sufficiently protected (ie. if they would have died without your protection), you are told what strength and type (direct / indirect) of attack they were dealt and what level of defence they had without you. If this happens, they will be dealt a Strength 4 attack at the end of the following day.

**Passive Abilities**: N/A

**Other Role Information**: 
You may not protect yourself.

**Win Condition**: Identify and eliminate all threats to the submarine.



**Role Name**: Naval Responder
**Alignment**: Technician (Town)

*When you graduated at the top of your class from the country’s best medical school, everyone thought you’d go on to do great things – becoming a world-class neurosurgeon, or curing cancer. But that’s not what you wanted for yourself. You love the thrill of the military, and nothing’s better than underwater expeditions. What greater purpose is there than saving those protecting your great nation?*

**Day Abilities**: N/A

**Night Abilities**: 
You may visit a player to protect them, granting them Level 2 defence. If a player attacks your target during the night, their attack strength is decreased by 1 level on their next attack.

**Passive Abilities**: N/A

**Other Role Information**:
You may not protect yourself.
You will not know if your target is attacked during the night.

**Win Condition**: Identify and eliminate all threats to the submarine.



**Role Name**: Ambusher
**Alignment**: Technician (Town)

*Nobody ever sees you coming. It’s how you racked up kills in the Special Forces, and how you got this gig on the Carcinus. Something about you just lets you… blend in. It’s a useful talent, especially when your directive is to kill. Hostiles only, of course…*

**Day Abilities**: N/A

**Night Abilities**: 
Visit a primary target, lying in wait for your secondary target. If your secondary target visits your primary target, you will deal them a Strength 2 attack. You will know if you successfully took a shot.

**Passive Abilities**: N/A

**Other Role Information**:
You may not list yourself as either target.

**Win Condition**: Identify and eliminate all threats to the submarine.



**Role Name**: Retired Infantryman
**Alignment**: Technician (Town)

*After doing two tours as a footsoldier, you wanted a change – a more relaxing deployment, some would say. So you put in a request, filled out the forms, and begged your commander for favours, and you got exactly what you wanted: a six-month tour on a nuclear submarine where you could just take it easy underwater. I mean, it’s peacetime – there’s nothing to do! At least, that’s what you thought before your team got killed on board your own ship. You got exactly what you wanted…*

**Day Abilities**: N/A

**Night Abilities**: 
Shoot a target, dealing them a Strength 1 attack. You cannot take shots on two consecutive days, nor on the first night, no matter what. Your shots count as a visit.

**Passive Abilities**: N/A

**Other Role Information**:
You have 3 bullets.

**Win Condition**: Identify and eliminate all threats to the submarine.



**Role Name**: Reflection Engineer
**Alignment**: Technician (Town)

*You've always been the protector among your peers, and now, aboard the submarine, you've taken the role quite literally. Your knowledge of advanced shielding techniques ensures that while you might not directly stop an attack, the attacker will think twice before striking again.*

**Day Abilities**: N/A

**Night Abilities**:
You may visit a player and envelop them with a mirror shield for the night. Any other non-damaging visits targeted at this player are reflected back onto the actor. [Note: Damaging actions will go through, but any secondary non-damaging effects associated with it will be reflected.]

**Passive Abilities**: N/A

**Other Role Information**: 
To prevent paradoxes, if your ability is in any way interfered with, it does not go through, and you will be informed of this.

**Win Condition**: Identify and eliminate all threats to the submarine.



**Role Name**: Backstairs Broker
**Alignment**: Technician (Town)

*As chief technologist on the Carcinus, people often look down on you. Sure, you’re not as strong as some of the former infantry on the ship, but you’re more powerful. Every movement on this ship, you know about. A mouse can’t even squeak on board without your devices picking it up. It’s time to put this technology to good use by uncovering and eliminating the hostiles on your ship.*

**Day Abilities**:
Bug a player to discover who they voted for.

**Night Abilities**: N/A

**Passive Abilities**:
Each night, you receive a list of players the Hackers visited. This list will be stripped of yourself and any dead players, including players killed the night in question.

**Other Role Information**: N/A

**Win Condition**: Identify and eliminate all threats to the submarine.



**Role Name**: Recon Agent
**Alignment**: Technician (Town)

*It’s funny how people just… tell you things. Maybe it’s the soothing tone of your voice. Or maybe it’s the drugs you slip into their food, putting them in a relaxed state of openness. Either way, it’s useful, and not just for gossip. Maybe if people tell you enough, you can figure out what’s been happening on this ship…*

**Day Abilities**: N/A

**Night Abilities**:
Visit another player to discover what happened to them that night. You receive all results they received which were not specific to their role.

**Passive Abilities**: N/A

**Other Role Information**: N/A

**Win Condition**: Identify and eliminate all threats to the submarine.



**Role Name**: Conflict Manager
**Alignment**: Technician (Town)

*"Rogue attacks? Tense. But a "democratic" solution where subversives have a say in who we throw out the goddamn AIRLOCK? That's intolerable. The Carcinus isn't a town hall meeting; it's a high-stakes battleground. The time has come to seize the reins of this fraught electoral process."*

**Day Abilities**:
Check three players to see who they vote for.

**Night Abilities**: N/A

**Passive Abilities**:
At the end of each day phase, you will receive a list of players who vote for you.

**Other Role Information**:
Your vote is worth 2.

**Win Condition**: Identify and eliminate all threats to the submarine.



**Role Name**: Bug Operator
**Alignment**: Technician (Town)

*Your touch on the controls reveals connections, like threads weaving through the crew's actions. It’s your job to meticulously piece together the puzzle of alliances and interactions. Whispers and exchanges become visible through your lens as if tracking them is second nature to you, shedding light on hidden paths and concealed motivations. It’s time to put your skills to the test to break down the network of hostiles trying to take down your ship!*

**Day Abilities**: N/A

**Night Abilities**:
Choose one player, and receive a list of all connections they have, specifying the phase each chat was set up and its creator. [Note: a connection is any channel created by a player which is not publicly visible but can be used for bidirectional, open, signed communication between living players.]

**Passive Abilities**: N/A

**Other Role Information**:
The Hackers’ private channel is exempt from your ability.

**Win Condition**: Identify and eliminate all threats to the submarine.



**Role Name**: Oceanic Cartographer
**Alignment**: Technician (Town)

*Your fingers trace delicate lines across aged maps. The submarine's charts sprawl before you, hiding the secrets and dangers of the hidden depths. Your fellow crewmates may traverse these waters, but you're the navigator, uncovering the stories whispered by the currents. It’s time to unveil the secrets beneath the waves.*

**Day Abilities**: N/A

**Night Abilities**:
Visit another player. You will receive the alignments, but not the names of everyone they came into contact with during the night (everyone they visited, or who visited them).

**Passive Abilities**: N/A

**Other Role Information**: N/A

**Win Condition**: Identify and eliminate all threats to the submarine.



**Role Name**: Course Charter
**Alignment**: Technician (Town)

*"Keep it steady. That's the motto," you mumble, adjusting the dials on your console. You never aimed for glory; just a reliable role in the belly of The Carcinus, ensuring everyone stays on course. But with systems haywire, you've adapted. Your console now controls more than just bearings; it influences people's decisions. A few tweaks, and you can divert focus, avert suspicions — reroute destiny itself.*

*"Well, let's see who's swerving off course today," you muse, your fingers hovering over the keys. You might not control the entire vessel, but you do hold sway over where individual attentions go. In the middle of this chaos, that's more power than most have. And you intend to use it to steer everyone toward calm waters, or rather, towards uncovering the traitors among you.*

**Day Abilities**: N/A

**Night Abilities**:
You may redirect all visits (not actions) from your base to the person you visit. Your chosen target will become your new base on the subsequent night.

**Passive Abilities**: N/A

**Other Role Information**:
Your starting base is yourself.

**Win Condition**: Identify and eliminate all threats to the submarine.



**Role Name**: Contingency Specialist
**Alignment**: Technician (Town)

*You've always had an uncanny ability to pick up on tasks just by observing. While some in the navy focus on honing a particular specialty, you became the jack-of-all-trades, ensuring that the submarine's operations never falter. Even if a crucial crew member goes down, your adaptable skills ensure the mission can still be accomplished. It's not about replacing them; it's about honoring their legacy by making sure their skills continue to serve the crew.*

**Day Abilities**: N/A

**Night Abilities**: Each night, visit one other player to train under them. You will copy a charge of their ability. You can also use one stored charge, provided the player you obtained it from is now a dead Town member.

**Passive Abilities**: N/A

**Other Role Information**: You cannot train under the same player twice.

**Win Condition**: Identify and eliminate all threats to the submarine.



**Role Name**: Hydrophone Manager
**Alignment**: Technician (Town)

*“Is this thing on?”
You fumble with the oddly-shaped device in your hands, almost dropping it to the floor.
“Looks like it needs to be plugged into the central computer.”
You untangle the mess of wires, and insert them into the slot marked hydrophone-receiver. A crackle sounds, and the box lights up.
“Anybody there?”*

**Day Abilities**: N/A

**Night Abilities**: N/A

**Passive Abilities**: 
You have access to <#1062457114724937859>, which listens out for voices from the ocean, but can’t quite make out who they’re from.

**Other Role Information**: N/A

**Win Condition**: Identify and eliminate all threats to the submarine.



**Role Name**: Wiring Expert
**Alignment**: Technician (Town)

*In the submarine's maze of wires, you're the ultimate tinkerer. Messing with the ship's switches and locks from a distance is second nature to you. Wanna keep someone in their bunk? Zap, their door's locked! It's like remote-controlled pranks, but with a helpful twist. So, when the crew needs a bit of fun mixed with security, they know who to turn to - you, the Wiring Expert!*

**Day Abilities**: N/A

You may visit a target to roleblock them, causing them to be unable to perform an action that night or the following day. They will be informed of this at the end of the night, unless they are immune to roleblocking.

**Role Name**: Special Operations Unit
**Alignment**: Disruptor (Neutral)

*In your early years, you were a prodigy — top of every class, exuding charisma, a golden child. At 13, that all shattered when a car crash took your parents, throwing you into a spiral of broken homes, abusive foster families, and drug addiction. Your salvation came at 17: a powerful and shadowy crime syndicate that auctions specialised and highly trained units with lethal skills to the highest bidder. Now, you've infiltrated The Carcinus. Your objective? Wipe out everyone and deliver this sub to your benefactor.*

**Day Abilities**: N/A

**Role Name**: Turbulence Driver
**Alignment**: Disruptor (Neutral)

*"They never saw it coming, did they?" You chuckle to yourself, peering through the terminal screen that gives you more control than anyone should ever have on The Carcinus. From communications to lights, you could say you're the submarine's unofficial DJ. A smirk traces your lips; your electronic tinkering got you kicked out of Naval school, but who's laughing now? You've tapped into the central systems, siphoning off resources and information at will.*

*"A few more 'adjustments', and my work here is done." You glance at the list of options on your screen, ready to unleash chaos. Your goal? Simple. Use all your skills to bring this vessel to its knees, all before anyone figures out the puppetmaster behind the glitches. They'll be too busy pointing fingers at each other to see it coming. And why? Just to prove that you can. The powerful handlers who put you here will be pleased, but you? You'll be ecstatic. "Alright, time to stir the waters," you murmur, fingers dancing over the keyboard.*

**Day Abilities**: N/A

**Night Abilities**:
You may use each of the following abilities once during the game.
- Comms Interception: Any player who sends more than 127 messages the following day phase will die.

**Role Name**: Naval Commander
**Alignment**: Disruptor (Neutral)

*“Alright, deep breath. You got this. In and out, ten days.”*
*You glance over at your scuba suit, tucked neatly behind your cabin bed. Ten days.*
*“This is Agent 02, special command, coming in. Can I get an inventory report?”*
*The line crackles, but there’s no reply. When the hackers knocked out the communication lines, they must have fried some of your equipment too. You’re gonna have to figure this one out on your own, and fast. It’s time to bring this thing crashing down – you wouldn’t want to disappoint your handler.*

**Day Abilities**: N/A

**Night Abilities**:
Each night, you may remotely issue an order to another player, forcing them to do your bidding. You can choose a target for them, and also learn their intended target.

**Role Name**: Scuba Diver
**Alignment**: Disruptor (Neutral)

*Can someone please get me off this fucking submarine already? All I hear is yap-yap-yapping all day long about hackers and nukes and all that bullshit. Nobody wants to swim any more. I hate the military. Only signed up because my dad made me. Hope he’s proud of me now. Soon as I get a chance, I'm gonna get myself out the airlock. Can’t even just do that myself any more. Gotta follow procedure, and let people vote and all that jazz. Society these days, I tell you.*
